        "## Problem Statement & Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "### Context:\n",
        "Network intrusion detection is a **critical cybersecurity challenge** where identifying malicious traffic in real-time can prevent data breaches, system compromises, and cyber attacks. Traditional signature-based detection methods fail against novel attack patterns, making machine learning-based approaches essential.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Problem Definition:\n",
        "**Binary Classification Problem:** Distinguish between BENIGN network traffic and ATTACK traffic using network flow statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset:\n",
        "- **Source:** CIC-IDS2017 from Kaggle (real-world network intrusion dataset)\n",
        "- **Size:** 2M+ samples with 78 network flow features\n",
        "- **Features:** Packet statistics, flow duration, protocol information, flags, etc.\n",
        "- **Target:** Binary label (0=Benign, 1=Attack)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Motivation:\n",
        "1. **Real-World Impact:** Deployed NIDS systems protect enterprise networks 24/7\n",
        "2. **Complexity:** Large-scale data with class imbalance and high dimensionality\n",
        "3. **ML Suitability:** Non-linear patterns require sophisticated classification algorithms\n",
        "4. **Evaluation Challenge:** Requires balanced precision-recall tradeoff (minimize false positives while catching real attacks)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Research Questions:\n",
        "1. Which ML algorithm best identifies network intrusions?\n",
        "2. What network features are most predictive of attacks?\n",
        "3. How well do models generalize to unseen attack patterns?\n",
        "4. Are predicted probabilities well-calibrated for real-world deployment?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approach:\n",
        "Train and compare **3 classification algorithms** (Logistic Regression, SVC, PCA+LR) with proper evaluation using train-test split, k-fold cross-validation, and comprehensive goodness-of-fit analysis."

        "\n",
        "### Problem Statement & Motivation:\n",
        "**Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** - A critical cybersecurity application requiring real-time identification of malicious network traffic. This is a non-trivial binary classification problem with 2M+ samples and 78 features, making it ideal for demonstrating advanced ML techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n",
        "- ✅ **Univariate Analysis:** Examined distribution of all 78 features\n",
        "- ✅ **Outlier Detection:** Applied IQR method for outlier identification and analysis\n",
        "- ✅ **Correlation Heatmaps:** Generated correlation matrices to identify feature relationships\n",
        "- ✅ **Class Imbalance:** Detected and addressed using balanced class weights\n",
        "- ✅ **Missing Values:** Handled systematically with appropriate imputation strategies\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Training Summary:\n",
        "- ✅ Trained 3 models: **Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, and PCA + Logistic Regression**\n",
        "- ✅ All models trained on properly scaled data to prevent data leakage\n",
        "- ✅ Performed **5-fold stratified cross-validation** on all models (Holdout + K-Fold CV ✅)\n",
        "- ✅ Enhanced hyperparameter tuning with **GridSearchCV** (30 parameter combinations)\n",
        "- ✅ Generated **ROC curves** for model discrimination analysis\n",
        "- ✅ Analyzed **feature importance** with directional impact (Attack vs Benign indicators)\n",
        "- ✅ Generated **optimized learning curves** for bias-variance tradeoff analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "### Classification \"Parity Plot\" Equivalents & Goodness-of-Fit:\n",
        "Since this is **classification** (not regression), we computed classification equivalents:\n",
        "- ✅ **Prediction Distribution Plots:** Train vs Test probability distributions (Classification \"Parity Plots\")\n",
        "- ✅ **Calibration Curves:** How well predicted probabilities match actual outcomes\n",
        "- ✅ **Brier Score:** Classification equivalent of **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)\n",
        "- ✅ **RMSCE:** Classification equivalent of **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Calibration Error)\n",

        "- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Classification metrics + calibration analysis + cross-validation\n",
        "\n",
        "### Files Generated:\n",
        "- `outputs/model_comparison.csv` - Model metrics comparison with best model indicator\n",
